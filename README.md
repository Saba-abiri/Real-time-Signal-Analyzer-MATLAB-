Real-time Signal Analyzer (MATLAB)
Overview
This MATLAB script implements a real-time signal analyzer that:

Captures streaming data (simulated or real)
Applies a bandpass filter (1-50 Hz)
Continuously updates a live plot
Features
âœ… Real-time signal acquisition
âœ… Bandpass filtering with Butterworth filter
âœ… Live visualization for dynamic signal monitoring

Installation
Ensure MATLAB is installed with the Signal Processing Toolbox.

Usage
Run the script:
If using real-time data, replace the new_data line with actual signal acquisition.
The script continuously updates the plot with filtered real-time data.
Stop the execution: Use Ctrl + C in the MATLAB command window.
Example Output
The output will be a real-time plot showing the filtered signal.

ðŸ“Œ Modify the filter settings (lowcut, highcut, order) to suit your needs!
